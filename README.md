-->The goal of this research is to create a model that, in response to user input, can 
reliably diagnose and forecast skin conditions. In order to analyse the symptoms 
and attributes supplied by the user and produce an accurate diagnosis or forecast 
of the skin disease, the model would probably use machine learning or artificial 
intelligence techniques. The project's goal is to ensure that the model's predictions 
are highly accurate so that users may rely on them when making medical 
recommendations or decisions.

 To create a user-friendly User Interface (UI) that accepts input from the user and 
foretells skin illness.

 -->This project's goal is to provide a user-friendly User Interface (UI) that enables 
users to enter symptoms or other details about their skin condition. To make it simple 
for consumers to navigate and enter their information, the user interface (UI) would 
probably feature interactive elements and an aesthetically pleasing layout. This user 
interface's primary goal is to make it easier to receive a skin disease prognosis or 
diagnosis based on the user's input. The project's goal is to provide an intuitive and 
user-friendly interface that improves usability and accessibility for those looking for 
advice or information about their skin.
